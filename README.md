# CIS OCI Landing Zone IAM Policy Module

 This module manages OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies, providing an RBAC (Role Based Access Control) framework that implements SoD (Separation of Duties) through template policies. Within this implementation, the Least Privilege security principle is enforced, as required by CIS (Center for Internet Security) OCI Foundations Benchmark.

 Check [module sepcification](./SPEC.md) for a full description of module requirements, supported variables, managed resources and outputs.

 The module operates in two non-exclusive modes: 
 - **Template policies**: this is the preferred mode. Policies are either driven off freeform tags applied to compartments (for compartment level policies) or from supplied roles assigned to groups passed to the module (for tenancy level policies).
 - **Supplied policies**: a map of policies is supplied to the module.

 Regardless the mode, the module checks policy statements against CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark recommendations. For example, the module would not allow a statement like *allow group to manage all-resources in tenancy*.

 ## 1) Template Policies

 In this mode policies are pre-configured, providing SoD across a set of pre-defined group roles. 
 
 Policies scoped at the compartment level are based on freeform tags applied to the compartments. These tags define a specific Landing Zone deployment, the compartment type and consumer groups. The module takes an input variable that is used to lookup the tagged compartments.
 
 Policies scoped at the tenancy level are based on groups roles passed to the module as input parameters.

 ### 1.1) Compartment Level Policies

The following **freeform tags** are required **on the compartments**:

#### cislz

Defines the specific Landing Zone deployment that the compartment belongs to. The assigned value must match the lookup value passed in the module *cislz_tag_lookup_value* input variable.

#### cislz-cmp-type

Defines the compartment's intent, or the resource types it is intended to be assigned. For instance, is it suuposed to be a compartment for network resources, for security resources, for both? 

Currently supported values:

- **security**: drives the creation of security related policies.
- **network**: drives the creation of network related policies.
- **application**: drives the creation of application related policies.
- **database**: drives the creation of database related policies.
- **exainfra**: drives the creation of Exatada Cloud Service related policies.
- **enclosing**: drives the creation of policies that are scoped to more than one compartment, as a compartment tagged as *enclosing* is intended to be the parent of the other compartment types.

Policies are always attached to the compartment itself.

The same compartment can be assigned one to multiple types, as a comma separated list. No policies are created if there is no tag assignment or an invalid value is provided.

Assignment examples: 

- cislz-cmp-type: security,network
- cislz-cmp-type: application,database,exainfra
- cislz-cmp-type: application
- cislz-cmp-type: enclosing

#### cislz-consumer-groups

Defines the groups that use (or consume) resources from the compartment. Since different groups have different roles (or consuming interests), the tag value has to communicate the role of each consuming group. Hence, each consuming group is specified as *\<group-role\>:\<group-name\>*

Currently supported values for *\<group-role\>*:

- **iam**: denotes an interest in IAM related resources.
- **security**: denotes an interest in security related resources.
- **network**: denotes an interest in network related resources.
- **application**: denotes an interest in application related resources.
- **database**:  denotes an interest in database related resources.
- **exainfra**: denotes an interest in Exadata Cloud Service related resources.
- **storage**: denotes an interest in storage related resources.
- **read**: denotes an interest in only reading resources in the compartment.
- **database-kms-dyn**: denotes an interest in key management resources to be consumed by a dynamic group of database instances.
- **compute-agent-dyn**: denotes an interest in resources to be consumed by a dynamic group of compute agents.

*\<group-name\>* can be any local or federated group name.

The same compartment can be assigned multiple consumer groups, as a comma-separated list. No policies are created if there is no tag assignment or an invalid value is provided.

Assignment examples: 

- cislz-consumer-groups: security:cislz-security-admin-group,network:cislz-network-admin-group,application:cislz-application-admin-group,database:cislz-database-admin-group,storage:cislz-storage-admin-group,read:cislz-readonly-group
- cislz-consumer-groups: iam:cislz-iam-admin-group,security:cislz-security-admin-group

**Important**: There is an implied relationship between *cislz-cmp-type* and the *\<group-role\>* in *cislz-consumer-groups* as far as *manage* permissions are concerned, according to table below:

**cislz-cmp-type** | **cislz-consumer-groups' \<group-role\>** | **Policy Outcome**
--------------|-------------|----------
*security* | *security* | *manage* permissions are granted over **security** related resources to *\<group-name\>* with *security* *\<group-role\>*.
*network* | *network* | *manage* permissions are granted over **network** related resources to *\<group-name\>* with *network* *\<group-role\>*.
*application* | *application* | *manage* permissions are granted over **application** related resources to *\<group-name\>* with *application* *\<group-role\>*.
*database* | *database* | *manage* permissions are granted over **database** related resources to *\<group-name\>* with *database* *\<group-role\>*.
*exainfra* | *exainfra* | *manage* permissions are granted over **Exadata Cloud Service** related resources to *\<group-name\>* with *exainfra* *\<group-role\>*.

#### A Concrete Example

As an example, let's assume the following tags are assigned to the *vision-network-cmp* compartment:

![Tagged Compartment](images/tagged-compartment.PNG)

- **cislz**: *vision* is the value the module tries to match with provided *cislz_tag_lookup_value* input variable for retrieving the compartment.
- **cislz-cmp-type**: *network* tells the module this compartment is about network resources, hence network policies should be pulled from the pre-configured template.
- **cislz-consumer-groups**: *security:vision-security-admin-group,application:vision-app-admin-group,database:vision-database-admin-group,network:vision-network-admin-group,storage:vision-storage-admin-group,exainfra:vision-exainfra-admin-group* communicates all consumer groups for the compartment resources. Since **cislz-cmp-type** is *network* and we have a group interested in *network* resources, the *vision-network-admin-group* group is granted management permissions on the network resources in the compartment. The other groups are granted permissions that are specific to their roles.

Per applied tags the module attaches the following policy to this compartment:

```

```

### 1.2) Tenancy Level Policies

Tenancy level policies are not based off compartment tags because they are applied at the root compartment level. Per design we decided not to tag the root compartment for policy configuration. Instead, tenancy level policies are configured per group roles passed into the module as input through *groups_with_tenancy_level_roles* variable.

Supported tenancy level roles:

- **iam**: grants IAM related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **cost**: grants cost related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **cred**: grants credential related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **security**: grants security related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **application**: grants (read-only) application related permissions at the tenancy level.
- **auditor**: grants (read-only) auditing permissions at the tenancy level.
- **announcement-reader**: grants announcement reading permissions at the tenancy level.
- **basic**: grants simple basic permissions at the tenancy level, specifically the ability to use cloud-shell and read usage-budgets.

As OCI supports 50 statements per policy, tenancy level grants are split into two policies: one for all groups with manage/use permissions over at least one resource and one for groups with only read/inspect + basic role permissions.

#### A Concrete Example

As an example, let's assume the following *groups_with_tenancy_level_roles* variable is passed to the module:

```
groups_with_tenancy_level_roles = [
    {"name":"vision-iam-admin-group",     "roles":"iam"},
    {"name":"vision-cred-admin-group",    "roles":"cred"},
    {"name":"vision-cost-admin-group",    "roles":"cost"},
    {"name":"vision-security-admin-group","roles":"security"},
    {"name":"vision-app-admin-group",     "roles":"application"},
    {"name":"vision-auditor-group",       "roles":"auditor"},
    {"name":"vision-announcement_reader-group","roles":"announcement-reader"},
    {"name":"vision-database-admin-group","roles":"basic"},
    {"name":"vision-exainfra-admin-group","roles":"basic"},
    {"name":"vision-storage-admin-group", "roles":"basic"}
  ]
```
The following two policies would be attached to the root compartment.

```

## 2) Supplied Policies

In this mode, policies are provided as an input parameter and can supplement or completely override the template policies.

For completely overriding the template policies, set variables *enable_compartment_level_template_policies* and *enable_tenancy_level_template_policies* to false."

Supplied policies are defined using the *custom_policies* map variable.
